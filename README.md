# Eloquent JavaScript

Hi there!

This repo is comprised of all the exercises from the book Eloquent JavaScript by Marjin Haverbeke.

Book Link: https://eloquentjavascript.net/

Follow along Sandbox: https://eloquentjavascript.net/code/

I've broken up the exercises by chapter and designated separate files for each exercise as well. I wanted this repo to be easy to follow for anyone that was looking for a particular solution to one of the challenges. This repo will be a work in progress for the foreseeable future, but I will update it once I have finished the book.


Check out some other JS challenges I've completed:
